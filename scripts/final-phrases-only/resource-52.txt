RESOURCE 52: SEVERE WEATHER HAZARDS
================================================================================
Category: Emergency & Safety - Natural Disaster Response
Difficulty: CRITICAL - Environment-Dependent
Context: Responding to dangerous weather during rideshare operations
Weather Authority: Information aligned with NOAA/National Weather Service
safety protocols and emergency management guidelines
Legal Note: You have RIGHT and RESPONSIBILITY to refuse trips in dangerous
weather. Your safety and passenger safety override platform obligations.
================================================================================

🚨 WHEN TO STOP DRIVING IMMEDIATELY 🚨

CEASE OPERATIONS if any of these conditions exist:
- Tornado warning (not watch, but WARNING = confirmed tornado)
- Flash flood warning with water over roadways
- Blizzard with zero visibility
- Ice storm making roads impassable
- Hurricane/tropical storm with sustained winds 40+ mph
- Any weather where you cannot safely control vehicle

NOAA Weather Radio Codes:
- WATCH = Conditions are favorable, be prepared
- WARNING = Happening now or imminent, take action immediately

Your life and passenger life are MORE IMPORTANT than any trip completion,
platform rating, or income lost from canceling rides.

================================================================================
SECTION 1: KEY TERMINOLOGY - SEVERE WEATHER VOCABULARY
================================================================================

1. Severe weather
   Context: Dangerous weather conditions threatening safety
   Clima severo

2. Tornado
   Context: Rotating column of air touching ground, extremely dangerous
   Tornado

3. Flash flood
   Context: Rapid flooding, extremely dangerous in vehicles
   Inundación repentina

4. Ice / Black ice
   Context: Frozen water on roadway (black ice = invisible ice)
   Hielo / Hielo negro

   Context: Cannot see road ahead due to fog, snow, rain, dust
   Visibilidad cero

6. Shelter
   Context: Safe building/structure for protection from severe weather
   Refugio

================================================================================
SECTION 2: TORNADO - IMMEDIATE LIFE-SAVING ACTIONS
================================================================================

🚨 TORNADO FACTS: Tornadoes kill 70+ people per year in vehicles. Your car is
a DEATH TRAP in a tornado. NEVER try to outrun a tornado. Get inside a
building immediately.

7. There's a tornado warning. We need to take shelter immediately. Follow me to [building/safe area].

   Context: Directing passenger to tornado shelter
   When to use: Tornado warning issued for your location
   Action: Pull over at FIRST substantial building (store, restaurant, bank)
   DO NOT attempt to complete trip - get inside NOW

   Hay una alerta de tornado. Necesitamos refugiarnos inmediatamente. Sígame hacia [edificio/área segura].

8. Taking emergency shelter due to tornado warning at [location]. Will update when safe.

   Context: Notifying platform/family of tornado shelter situation
   When to use: After securing shelter, text family/platform
   Documentation: Creates record of emergency situation

   Tomando refugio de emergencia debido a alerta de tornado en [ubicación]. Actualizaré cuando esté a salvo.

TORNADO SHELTER PROTOCOL:
1. Get inside substantial building immediately
2. Go to lowest floor (basement if available)
3. Interior room with no windows (bathroom, closet, hallway)
4. Get under sturdy furniture if possible
5. Cover head and neck with arms
6. Stay away from windows
7. DO NOT stay in vehicle
8. DO NOT shelter under highway overpass (creates wind tunnel effect)
9. Wait for all-clear from authorities before emerging

WHAT TO DO IF CAUGHT IN OPEN:
- Lie flat in ditch or low-lying area (lower than road level)
- Cover head and neck with arms
- DO NOT stay in or near vehicle
- Vehicle can become projectile

================================================================================
SECTION 3: FLASH FLOODING - WATER HAZARDS
================================================================================

🚨 FLOOD FACTS: Flooding is #1 weather-related killer in US. 6 inches of
moving water can knock you down. 12 inches can carry away a car. You CANNOT
judge water depth or current by looking. NEVER drive through flooded roads.

9. The road ahead is flooded. For safety, I must take an alternate route or end the trip here.

   Context: Explaining inability to continue due to flooding
   When to use: Water visible over roadway ahead
   Critical rule: Turn Around Don't Drown - NEVER drive through water
   Safety decision: Ending trip protects both driver and passenger

   El camino adelante está inundado. Por seguridad, debo tomar una ruta alternativa o terminar el viaje aquí.

FLOOD SAFETY RULES:
❌ NEVER drive through flooded roads
❌ NEVER drive around barricades (they're there for reason)
❌ NEVER assume water is shallow enough
❌ NEVER assume your vehicle can make it

WHY THESE RULES SAVE LIVES:
- Depth impossible to judge (water may cover deep hole)
- Current can sweep vehicle away in seconds
- Electrical systems fail, cannot exit electric windows
- Vehicle can flip in current
- Drowning risk if trapped
- 50% of flood deaths occur in vehicles

IF CAUGHT IN FLOODING:
1. Abandon vehicle immediately if water rising
2. Move to higher ground
3. Call 911 if trapped
4. If vehicle swept away: exit immediately, swim perpendicular to current
5. Climb on roof if cannot evacuate
6. DO NOT return to vehicle until authorities declare safe

================================================================================
SECTION 4: ICE & WINTER WEATHER
================================================================================

🚨 ICE FACTS: Black ice is invisible - looks like wet pavement but is frozen.
Ice forms first on bridges, overpasses, and shaded areas. 4-wheel drive does
NOT help you stop on ice. Ice reduces traction by 90%.

10. Road conditions are icy. I need to drive much slower than normal for everyone's safety.

    Context: Managing passenger expectations during ice conditions
    When to use: Icy roads require reduced speed
    Safety over speed: You may arrive late, but you'll arrive alive

    Las condiciones del camino están heladas. Necesito conducir mucho más lento de lo normal por la seguridad de todos.

ICE DRIVING PROTOCOL:
- Reduce speed by 50-75% of posted limit
- Increase following distance to 8-10 seconds
- Brake gently and early
- No sudden steering movements
- Avoid bridges and overpasses when possible
- If vehicle starts sliding: steer into slide, don't brake
- If conditions deteriorate: park and wait for improvement

BLACK ICE WARNING SIGNS:
- Temperature near or below freezing (32°F / 0°C)
- Mist or light rain with cold temps
- Shiny appearance on road
- Other vehicles sliding or moving erratically
- Bridges and shaded areas most dangerous

IF YOU START SLIDING ON ICE:
1. Take foot off accelerator
2. DO NOT brake hard (will worsen slide)
3. Steer in direction of slide
4. Let vehicle slow naturally
5. Once traction regained, brake gently

WHEN TO STOP DRIVING:
- Roads become ice rinks (cannot maintain control)
- Multiple accidents observed
- Vehicle cannot maintain traction
- Other traffic has stopped
- Weather service advises no travel

================================================================================
SECTION 5: REDUCED VISIBILITY - FOG, SNOW, DUST
================================================================================

11. I need to drive slower/stop temporarily due to dangerous weather conditions. Your safety is my priority.

    Context: General severe weather safety communication
    When to use: Any weather requiring reduced speed or temporary stop
    Passenger reassurance: Explaining safety-first approach

    Necesito conducir más lento/detenerme temporalmente debido a condiciones climáticas peligrosas. Su seguridad es mi prioridad.

ZERO VISIBILITY PROTOCOL:
If you cannot see road:
1. Turn on hazard lights
2. Pull off road completely if possible
3. Turn off all lights (prevents others following you off road)
4. Take foot off brake (brake lights can confuse other drivers)
5. Wait for visibility improvement
6. DO NOT continue driving blind

FOG SAFETY:
- Use low beam headlights (high beams reflect off fog)
- Reduce speed significantly
- Use fog lights if equipped
- Follow road edge line, not center line
- Increase following distance
- If cannot see: pull completely off road and wait

HEAVY SNOW:
- Watch for whiteout conditions
- Use low gears for better control
- Clear ALL windows before driving (not just small hole)
- Brush snow off hood and roof (can blow onto windshield)
- Keep extra distance from snowplows
- If stuck: stay with vehicle, run engine 10min/hour for heat

================================================================================
SECTION 6: TRIP CANCELLATION - WEATHER TOO DANGEROUS
================================================================================

12. Due to severe weather conditions, I cannot safely complete this trip. The platform can arrange alternative transportation.

    Context: Canceling trip due to unsafe weather
    When to use: Weather conditions exceed safe driving capability
    Platform support: They will arrange alternate ride at no charge to passenger
    Your right: Safety-based cancellations are protected

    Debido a condiciones climáticas severas, no puedo completar este viaje de forma segura. La plataforma puede organizar transporte alternativo.

CANCELING FOR WEATHER:
You have RIGHT to cancel if:
- Weather exceeds your safe driving ability
- Local authorities advise no travel
- Weather service issues severe warning
- You cannot safely control vehicle
- Visibility is insufficient
- Roads are impassable

HOW TO CANCEL:
1. Explain situation to passenger (use phrase #12)
2. Cancel trip in app with "unsafe conditions" reason
3. Do NOT charge passenger
4. Help passenger request alternate ride
5. Document conditions (photos, screenshot weather alert)
6. Move to safe location and wait out weather

PLATFORM RESPONSE:
- Most platforms support weather cancellations
- Document with weather service screenshot
- Multiple cancellations in severe weather won't hurt standing
- Passenger typically not charged for weather cancellation

SECTION 7: SEVERE WEATHER MONITORING & PREPARATION
================================================================================

BEFORE YOUR SHIFT:
□ Check weather forecast for entire shift duration
□ Note any watches/warnings for your area
□ Plan route avoiding flood-prone areas in rain
□ Check road conditions report
□ Ensure phone is charged (weather alerts)
□ Have emergency supplies in vehicle

EMERGENCY WEATHER SUPPLIES:
□ Phone charger / power bank
□ Weather radio or reliable weather app
□ Flashlight
□ Blanket
□ Drinking water
□ Non-perishable snacks
□ First aid kit
□ Ice scraper / snow brush (winter)
□ Kitty litter or sand (for traction on ice)

WEATHER MONITORING TOOLS:
- NOAA Weather Radio (broadcast on FM)
- Weather service app with alerts enabled
- Local news station apps
- Platform driver app (often includes weather alerts)
- Road conditions hotline for your state

SEASONAL CONSIDERATIONS:

SPRING (Tornado Season):
- Peak season: March-June
- Monitor weather closely in afternoon/evening
- Know locations of sturdy buildings on your routes
- Have tornado shelter plan for common areas

SUMMER (Flash Floods, Heat):
- Monitor flash flood watches
- Avoid low-lying areas during heavy rain
- Never drive through water
- Stay hydrated, watch for heat exhaustion

FALL (Hurricane Season):
- Monitor hurricane track if coastal area
- Evacuate if ordered (don't drive during hurricane)
- Prepare for power outages

WINTER (Ice, Snow, Blizzard):
- Check road conditions before shift
- Watch for black ice in morning/evening
- Keep gas tank above half (prevents line freeze)
- Dress warmly in case of breakdown

================================================================================
SEVERE WEATHER DECISION MATRIX
================================================================================

SHOULD I DRIVE IN THIS WEATHER?

ASK YOURSELF:
1. Can I see the road clearly ahead?
   NO = Don't drive

2. Can I safely control my vehicle?
   NO = Don't drive

3. Are roads passable?
   NO = Don't drive

4. Has weather service advised no travel?
   YES = Don't drive

5. Are emergency vehicles having difficulty?
   YES = Don't drive

6. Would I be comfortable with my family member driving in this?
   NO = Don't drive

When in doubt, don't go out. No trip is worth your life or your passenger's
life. The platform WILL support safety-based decisions. Lost income from
canceled trips is cheaper than a hospital bill or funeral.
