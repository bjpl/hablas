===== MULTI-APP STRATEGY =====
(2025 optimization note: Most successful gig workers use 2-3 platforms simultaneously. Advanced strategy requires understanding each platform's algorithms, surge patterns, and terms of service. Some platforms prohibit simultaneous active orders - know the rules.)

===== CORE CONCEPTS =====

Multi-apping

Multi-apping

Multi-aplicaciones / Trabajar múltiples apps
(Strategy: Running multiple gig apps (Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, Instacart) simultaneously to maximize order selection and minimize downtime. Most effective during slow periods.)

Cherry-picking

Cherry-picking

Selección selectiva / Escoger los mejores
(Optimization: Strategically accepting only high-value orders (high pay, short distance, good restaurant). Key metric: dollars per mile. Target $2+ per mile minimum in 2025 markets.)

===== EFFICIENCY METRICS =====

Dead miles / Unpaid miles

Dead miles / Unpaid miles

Millas muertas / Millas no pagadas
(Critical concept: Miles driven without pay - returning from delivery, driving to pickup. Reduce dead miles by ending dashes in high-demand areas, accepting orders with return direction.)

Stacking / Double-dipping

Stacking / Double-dipping

Apilar / Doble ganancia
(Advanced technique: Combining orders from multiple platforms on same route. CAUTION: Violates TOS on most platforms if done simultaneously. Single-platform stacking is encouraged and built-in.)

===== STRATEGY DISCUSSIONS =====

(Context: Common among experienced gig workers. Typical combinations: Uber+Lyft for rideshare, DoorDash+Uber Eats for delivery, Instacart+Shipt for grocery.)

(Networking tip: Drivers share zone strategies, best times for each platform, restaurant partnerships. Local knowledge compounds earnings potential.)

===== 2025 BEST PRACTICES =====
- Keep max 2 platforms active simultaneously
- Pause non-active app before accepting order
- Track metrics: $/hour, $/mile, acceptance rates
- Zone expertise > platform loyalty
- Peak hours: 11am-2pm, 5pm-9pm weekdays
- Weekend nights highest earnings potential
- Weather events = surge opportunities
- Build restaurant relationships for priority pickup
