===== DOORDASH DELIVERY =====
(2025 platform note: DoorDash uses dynamic pricing with base pay, peak pay, and tips. Acceptance rate no longer affects Top Dasher status - completion rate and customer rating are key metrics.)

===== PLATFORM TERMINOLOGY =====

Dasher

Dasher

(Context: Official term for DoorDash delivery drivers.)

===== EARNINGS STRUCTURE =====

Peak Pay

Peak Pay

(2025 optimization: Peak pay appears during high demand. Ranges from $1-$10+ per order. Watch for peak pay notifications in app - they indicate hot zones.)

Base pay

Base pay

Pago base
(Context: Starting at $2-$3 per order in 2025, base pay increases with distance, time, and desirability. Orders declined by multiple dashers show higher base pay.)

===== PERFORMANCE METRICS =====

Completion rate

Completion rate

Tasa de finalización
(Critical metric: Must maintain 80%+ completion rate to avoid deactivation. Only unassign orders before pickup if absolutely necessary.)

Acceptance rate

Acceptance rate

Tasa de aceptación
(2025 update: No longer affects Top Dasher qualification in most markets. Strategic declining of low-value orders can increase hourly earnings.)

===== ESSENTIAL EQUIPMENT =====

Hot Bag / Red Card

Hot Bag / Red Card

===== ORDER TYPES =====
