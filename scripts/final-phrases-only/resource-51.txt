VEHICLE BREAKDOWN PROTOCOLS
================================================================================

PREVENTION (Before breakdowns happen):
□ Pre-shift vehicle inspection (5 minutes can prevent breakdowns)
□ Check: tire pressure, fluid levels, warning lights, fuel level
□ Address warning lights immediately - don't ignore them
□ Keep emergency supplies: jumper cables, tire inflator, flashlight
□ Maintain regular service schedule
□ Never start shift with less than 1/4 tank fuel
□ Monitor temperature gauge during driving

WHEN BREAKDOWN OCCURS:

STEP 1: SAFETY FIRST (0-30 seconds)
- Turn on hazard lights immediately
- Pull to rightmost safe location (shoulder, parking lot)
- If cannot reach safe location: Call 911 for assistance
- If on highway: Get as far right as possible
- Do NOT stop in traffic lane or on curve

STEP 2: ASSESS SITUATION (30 seconds - 2 minutes)
- Can vehicle be restarted? (dead battery, overheating cooldown)
- Is it safe to attempt quick fix? (tire change on safe road)
- Is tow truck required? (major mechanical failure)
- Are you in a safe location? (well-lit, public, not isolated)

STEP 3: COMMUNICATE WITH PASSENGER (2-5 minutes)
- Use phrase #9: Explain breakdown occurred
- Use phrase #11: Cannot continue trip
- Use phrase #13: They won't be charged
- Keep calm and professional tone
- Answer their questions honestly

STEP 4: ARRANGE REPLACEMENT RIDE (5-10 minutes)
- Contact platform support through driver app
- Report breakdown and need for passenger replacement
- Use phrase #14: Platform will arrange replacement at no charge
- Use phrase #15: Help them request new driver
- Wait with passenger until replacement arrives if safe to do so

STEP 5: GET ASSISTANCE FOR VEHICLE (after passenger handled)
- Call roadside assistance (platform may provide)
- OR call your insurance roadside service
- OR call private tow truck
- Provide location, vehicle description, problem description
- Note: you are responsible for tow/repair costs in most cases

STEP 6: PLATFORM NOTIFICATION
- Mark trip as "mechanical failure" in app
- Document: time of breakdown, location, issue description
- Upload photos of issue if relevant
- Note any safety concerns
- Request trip cancellation/refund for passenger

================================================================================
SPECIFIC BREAKDOWN SCENARIOS
================================================================================

FLAT TIRE:
If safe to change:
1. Pull far off road to flat surface
2. Engage parking brake
3. Use jack and spare tire
4. Takes 15-20 minutes if experienced
5. Consider calling assistance if uncomfortable

If NOT safe to change:
- Highway shoulder, night time, unstable ground
- Call roadside assistance instead
- Passenger should request new ride immediately

OVERHEATING:
1. Turn off A/C, turn heat to MAX (pulls heat from engine)
2. Pull over safely as soon as possible
3. Do NOT open radiator cap (can cause severe burns)
4. Let engine cool 30-45 minutes
5. Check coolant level when cool
6. May need tow if severe

DEAD BATTERY:
1. Turn off all accessories
2. Attempt jump start if cables and another vehicle available
3. Let vehicle run 20+ minutes after jump to recharge
4. Replace battery ASAP - may die again
5. Have alternator tested - may be charging issue

OUT OF GAS:
1. This is preventable - monitor fuel gauge!
2. Call roadside assistance for fuel delivery
3. OR walk to gas station with gas can (only if safe)
4. This is YOUR fault - be especially apologetic to passenger
5. Platform may penalize repeated fuel incidents

STRANGE NOISES/SMELLS:
- Burning smell: Pull over immediately, possible fire risk
- Grinding metal: Possible brake failure - safety critical
- Hissing/steam: Overheating or coolant leak
- Thumping: Possibly tire issue
- When in doubt: pull over and investigate

================================================================================
PASSENGER SAFETY DURING BREAKDOWN
================================================================================

IF ON HIGHWAY/BUSY ROAD:
- Keep passengers IN vehicle with seatbelts on
- Standing on roadside is extremely dangerous
- 275+ pedestrians killed yearly on highway shoulders
- If must exit: exit away from traffic side, move far from road

IF IN SAFE PARKING LOT/SIDE STREET:
- Passengers may exit vehicle
- Direct them to safe waiting area (store, shade, bench)
- Stay with them until replacement ride arrives if possible

IF IN DANGEROUS/ISOLATED AREA:
- Call 911 for police assistance
- Stay in locked vehicle until help arrives
- Drive slowly to safer area if possible (even on flat tire at slow speed)

================================================================================
FINANCIAL & INSURANCE CONSIDERATIONS
================================================================================

WHO PAYS FOR WHAT:

Towing/Repair Costs:
- Generally YOUR responsibility as vehicle owner
- Your auto insurance may cover (check policy)
- Roadside assistance coverage helps (AAA, insurance add-on)
- Platform does NOT typically cover your vehicle repairs

Lost Income:
- You lose income while vehicle out of service
- Most platforms do NOT compensate for breakdown time
- This is why regular maintenance is critical
- Consider backup plan (rental car option, backup vehicle)

Passenger Refund:
- Platform typically refunds incomplete trip
- Does NOT come from your earnings
- Passenger not charged for failed service

Platform Fees:
- Some platforms charge cancellation fee for breakdown
- Multiple breakdowns may affect account standing
- Maintain vehicle properly to avoid penalties

Insurance Considerations:
- Report any accidents/damage to insurance immediately
- Check if your rideshare endorsement covers breakdown situations
- Roadside assistance coverage highly recommended
- Keep proof of regular maintenance for insurance claims

================================================================================
AFTER BREAKDOWN RESOLUTION
================================================================================

BEFORE RETURNING TO SERVICE:
□ Vehicle fully repaired and tested
□ Pre-shift inspection completed
□ All warning lights cleared
□ Test drive with no passengers to confirm repair
□ Update platform if required to return to active status

PREVENTING FUTURE BREAKDOWNS:
□ Schedule regular maintenance per manufacturer recommendations
□ Address warning lights immediately
□ Keep emergency supplies in vehicle
□ Monitor fuel gauge (never below 1/4 tank on shift)
□ Pre-shift inspection routine every day
□ Build relationship with reliable mechanic
□ Consider extended warranty for older vehicles
□ Budget for vehicle maintenance (set aside 10-15% of earnings)

EMERGENCY SUPPLY CHECKLIST:
□ Jumper cables or portable jump starter
□ Tire inflator / Fix-a-Flat
□ Flashlight with extra batteries
□ Reflective triangles or road flares
□ Basic tool kit
□ Rag and paper towels
□ Phone charger / power bank
□ First aid kit
□ Drinking water
□ Emergency contact numbers written down

================================================================================

Remember: Regular vehicle maintenance is cheaper than breakdowns. A 5-minute
pre-shift inspection can prevent 90% of breakdown situations. Your vehicle is
your business - maintain it like the investment it is.
