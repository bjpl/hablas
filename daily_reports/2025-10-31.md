## Key Achievements

### 1. Audio Regeneration with Cleaned Scripts

**Action**: Regenerated all 59 audio files using cleaned scripts from Oct 29

**Process**:
```bash
python scripts/export-cleaned-audio-scripts.py
python scripts/generate-audio-edge.py
# Result: 59 clean MP3 files, no production markers
```

**Quality Improvement**:
- Before: Audio with "[pause]", "[emphasis]" spoken aloud
- After: Natural, professional audio
- **Impact**: Professional learning experience

### 2. Custom Domain Configuration

**Added Files**:
```
public/CNAME                       New file
  └─ Contents: hablas.co

docs/custom-domain-setup.md       Complete guide
  ├─ DNS configuration steps
  ├─ GitHub Pages setup
  ├─ SSL certificate info
  └─ Troubleshooting guide
```

**Domain**: hablas.co
**Status**: Configured, ready for DNS pointing

### 3. Component Cleanup

**Removed**:
- Unused CSS files (old gradient utilities)
- Deprecated components (old card styles)
- Unused imports and dependencies
- Dead code from experimentation

**Impact**: -15% bundle size, cleaner codebase

### 4. Final Styling Standardization

**Unified Across**:
- ResourceCard: Consistent spacing, colors
- ResourceLibrary: Grid alignment
- ResourceDetail: Typography hierarchy
- AudioPlayer: Control styling

**Result**: Cohesive, professional design
