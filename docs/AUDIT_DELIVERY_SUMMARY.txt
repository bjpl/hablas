================================================================================
CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED
================================================================================

ISSUE 1: PRODUCTION METADATA CONTAMINATION (CRITICAL)
  Affected: Resources 10, 13, 18
  Violation: Standard C1 (No Technical Metadata)
  Markers Found: 130+ total
  Examples:
    - [Tone: Warm, encouraging, energetic]
    - [Speaker: Spanish narrator - friendly voice]
    - [PAUSE: 3 seconds]
    - [Phonetic: JAI! AI JAV...]
    - [00:00] TIMESTAMP markers
  Impact: Students will hear/read production notes instead of pure learning content
  Example: Audio will say "[PAUSE: 3 seconds]" instead of silence
  Fix: Complete script rebuild removing all metadata
  Time: 115 minutes total

ISSUE 2: PLACEHOLDER SYNTAX (MODERATE)
  Affected: Resource 6
  Violation: Standard A2 (Phrase Accuracy)
  Examples:
    - "Order for [customer name]" (should be "Order for Michael")
    - "Order number [####]" (should be "Order number 4523")
    - "Are you [customer name]?" (should be "Are you Sarah?")
  Impact: Audio will speak "[customer name]" literally; not practical for learning
  Fix: Replace placeholders with example values
  Time: 5 minutes

ISSUE 3: TRUNCATED PHRASES (MODERATE)
  Affected: Resources 5, 20
  Violation: Standard E7 (Translation Completeness)
  Examples:
    - Resource 5: "Can you double-check this order? The" (missing end)
    - Resource 20: "No problem. You can cancel through the" (missing "app")
  Impact: Audio incomplete, doesn't make sense, learner confusion
  Fix: Complete the sentences
  Time: 6 minutes total

ISSUE 4: MINOR METADATA (LOW)
  Affected: Resource 7
  Violation: Borderline C1 (No Technical Metadata)
  Issue: First line has "**Focus**: Essential delivery phrases with clear pronunciation"
  Impact: Minimal - just instructional marker on first line
  Fix: Delete line 1
  Time: 1 minute
