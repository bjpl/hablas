## Pattern for Completion

Each resource needs:
1. **Read** the incomplete file (find exact cutoff point)
2. **Complete missing phrases** (usually 6-10 remaining)
3. **Add closing sections**:
   - Resumen y Próximos Pasos
   - Tips de Oro
   - Próximos Pasos
   - Community info
4. **Ensure proper formatting** (all boxes closed)
5. **Verify line count** (600-900 lines for complete)

## Next Steps

### To Complete Remaining 20:

**Option 1**: Continue with Claude Code (me) completing them manually
- Pros: Free, high quality, context-aware
- Cons: Takes time, uses conversation context
- Time: ~30-45 minutes for all 20

**Option 2**: Use the regeneration script
- Pros: Automated, validated, batch processing
- Cons: Needs API key
- Time: ~1 hour total

**Option 3**: Hybrid - I complete critical 5-10, defer rest
- Focus on: Most-used resources (basic greetings, directions)
- Defer: Less common (intermediate smalltalk, etc.)

## Recommendation

**Continue with me completing them** - I have plenty of context remaining (706k tokens) and can ensure quality and consistency with the 2 I've already done.

**Priority Order**:
1. Conductor basic_greetings (3 files) - CRITICAL
2. Repartidor basic_phrases (2 remaining)
3. Conductor basic_directions (3 files)
4. All category basics (numbers, time, emergency)
5. Intermediate resources

Should I continue completing all 20 remaining resources?
