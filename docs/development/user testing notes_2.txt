Hablas User Testing - Round 2 Notes (Organized)
Overview
This is a follow-up testing round for Hablas, focusing on the admin portal and content review functionality. The core issue remains: the review/edit workflow is not fully implemented or integrated.

Content Review/Edit Workflow
This is the core area needing attention. The review interface has multiple tabs, but none are functioning as intended.

Core Problem Analysis
The review workflow has structural issues that need to be addressed before further development:
Current State:

Multiple tabs exist (Reference, Audio Script, Verify Audio, Compare All)
Tabs are inconsistently implemented across resources
Data/content not loading or integrating properly
The conceptual model for these tabs isn't clear

What's Needed:
A thoughtful, intentional design for the review workflow that:

Aligns with modern conventions for content review tasks
Has clear purpose for each tab/view
Is consistently implemented across all resources
Properly integrates audio, transcripts, and text content


Summary: Action Items
Critical (Blocking Review Workflow)

Fix content loading in Reference tab (currently blank)
Fix Verify Audio tab errors
Ensure audio and resource files load consistently across all resources
Design and document the intended review workflow before further implementation

High Priority (Architecture/Design)

Rethink tab structure and naming conventions
Define what each tab should display and why
Research modern conventions for audio/transcript/content review workflows
Ensure Compare All view has clear purpose and both panels populated

Low Priority (Polish)

Update footer from "Made in Medellín" to "Made in California"


Recommendation: Review Workflow Design Session
Before continuing to build out the review interface, I'd suggest stepping back to define the workflow clearly. Here are some questions to consider:
What content types need to be reviewed?

Audio recordings
Audio transcripts
Web/text content
PDF/downloadable resources

What are the review tasks?

Verify audio quality and accuracy
Check transcript alignment with audio
Compare source content across formats
Edit and approve final versions

What views would support these tasks?
Based on your earlier feedback about the "triple comparison," a cleaner model might be:
