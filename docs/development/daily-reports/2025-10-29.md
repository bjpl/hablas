## Key Achievements

### 1. Audio Script Cleaning System

**Problem Identified**:
- Audio scripts contained production markers: "[pause]", "[emphasis]", "[slow]"
- Box-drawing characters in text (┌─┐│└┘)
- Formatting directions visible in final audio

**Solution Created**:
```python
# scripts/export-cleaned-audio-scripts.py
- Removes production markers
- Cleans box-drawing characters
- Preserves line breaks and structure
- Outputs clean text for TTS
```

**Impact**: Professional audio without distracting production markers

### 2. Content Display Refinement

**Box-Drawing Character Handling**:
- Created elegant PhraseBox component
- Replaced ASCII art with CSS styling
- Maintained visual structure without unicode characters
- Better mobile rendering

**Typography Improvements**:
- Removed all gradients (final cleanup from Oct 28)
- Simplified card styling to clean white
- Enhanced markdown rendering
- Better spacing and readability

### 3. Build-Time Optimization

**Static Export Enhancement**:
- Load resource content at build time
- Pre-process all markdown
- Clean special characters before build
- Smaller runtime bundle

## Technical Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Build-Time Content Processing

**Context**: Box-drawing characters and production markers in content

**Decision**: Process and clean content at build time, not runtime

**Rationale**:
- Faster runtime (no processing needed)
- Cleaner separation of build vs runtime
- Easier to verify output
- Better for static export

### Decision 2: Preserve Markdown Structure

**Critical Fix**: Keep empty lines in markdown

**Context**: Previous cleaning removed empty lines, breaking markdown formatting

**Impact**: Lists, paragraphs, and code blocks now render correctly

**Learning**: When cleaning text, preserve structural whitespace
