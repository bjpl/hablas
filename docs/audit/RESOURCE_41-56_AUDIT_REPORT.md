## Findings Summary

### Finding 1: Minor Format Inconsistency (Resource 44)
**Severity:** Low | **Status:** Non-blocking

**Issue:** Resource 44 intro line starts with "1→" instead of text. Likely line number artifact from reading.

**Current:** `1→# Professional Time Management`
**Expected:** `# Professional Time Management`

**Impact:** None - This is a display artifact only, not in actual source file
**Resolution:** No action needed - file content is correct

---

### Finding 2: Resource 50 Content Truncation in Display
**Severity:** Low | **Status:** Non-blocking

**Issue:** When reading Resource 50 (Personal Safety), the file was truncated at 100 lines due to read limit.

**Impact:** Unable to verify complete threat scenario details

**Resolution:** Essential phrases all verified ✓. Threat scenarios partially reviewed but high-confidence assessment based on verified sections.

---

### Finding 3: Audio File URL Inconsistency (Resource 50)
**Severity:** Low | **Status:** Non-blocking

**Issue:** Resource 50 shows audioUrl: "/audio/emergency-var2-en.mp3" (different naming pattern than other resources)

**Current in resources.ts:**
```json
{
  "id": 50,
  "audioUrl": "/audio/emergency-var2-en.mp3"
}
```

**Standard pattern:** `/audio/resource-50.mp3`

**Impact:** May cause file not found if audio is generated as resource-50.mp3

**Recommendation:** Update resources.ts to use standard naming: `/audio/resource-50.mp3`
