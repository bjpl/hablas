# Complete Phrase Coverage Audit Report

**Audit Date:** $(date)
**Auditor:** PhraseCoverageAuditor Agent

## Executive Summary

This audit identifies ALL resources with incomplete phrase coverage by comparing:
1. Phrase count in source markdown files (from "### Frase X:" markers)
2. Phrase count in extracted phrase files (scripts/final-phrases-only/resource-X.txt)

## Critical Findings

### Resources with INCOMPLETE Coverage (< 100%)


**Total Incomplete Resources:** 0
**Total Missing Phrases:** 0

### Resources with COMPLETE Coverage (100%+)


**Total Complete Resources:** 0

- Resource 24 (no extraction file found)

## Action Plan

### Priority 1: Resources with Incomplete Coverage
These resources need phrase regeneration to cover ALL phrases from the markdown:


### Estimated Work

- **Resources to Regenerate:** 0
- **Total Missing Phrases:** 0
- **Estimated Time:** ~0 minutes (at 30 seconds per phrase)

## Recommendations

1. **Regenerate audio for all incomplete resources** to cover 100% of phrases
2. **Investigate missing source markdowns** for resources with extractions but no source
3. **Create missing extractions** for resources with sources but no extraction files
4. **Verify 15-phrase limit** was not incorrectly applied to resources 1-37
