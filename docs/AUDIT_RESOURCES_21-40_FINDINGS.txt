RESOURCE ISSUES REQUIRING ATTENTION
================================================================================

Resource 21: Production Notes (91 instances)
  Markers: [Tone:], [Speaker:], [Phonetic:], [PAUSE:]
  Priority: HIGH (blocks deployment)
  Effort: 15-20 minutes
  Fix: Remove all markers; preserve phrases
  Validation: No brackets should remain

Resource 34: Production Notes (57 instances)
  Markers: [Tone:], [Speaker:], [Phonetic:], [PAUSE:]
  Priority: HIGH (blocks deployment)
  Effort: 10-15 minutes
  Fix: Remove all markers; preserve phrases
  Validation: No brackets should remain

PROCESS RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

Immediate Improvements:
  1. Add production note detection to QA pipeline
  2. Use cleaner script template (like Resource 28 format)
  3. Add pre-generation validation
  4. Document forbidden markers clearly

Future Prevention:
  1. Template scripts without metadata
  2. Automated marker detection
  3. Validation before audio generation
  4. Post-generation audio scanning
