## Why This Is Correct

### Evidence:
1. **Cultural comparisons** reference Colombia as "home" culture
2. **Pronunciation guides** use Spanish phonetics for English words
3. **Target audience** explicitly stated as gig workers in US
4. **Phrases** show English as learning target, Spanish as comprehension aid
5. **Context** explains US work environment to Colombian workers

### Example of Correct Pattern:
```json
{
  "english": "Are you okay?",           ← What to SAY (target)
  "spanish": "¿Está bien?",             ← What it MEANS (helper)
  "pronunciation": "ar yoo oh-KAY",     ← How to pronounce
  "colombianComparison": "..."          ← Cultural bridge
}
```
