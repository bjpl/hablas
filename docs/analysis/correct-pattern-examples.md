## Key Evidence Markers

### 1. Cultural Comparisons Always Reference Colombia as "Home"
Every resource includes comparisons like:
- "Different from Colombian..."
- "Unlike Colombian system..."
- "More formal than Colombian..."
- "Less social than Colombian..."
- "Colombia doesn't have..."

**Interpretation:** Users are FROM Colombia, learning about US

### 2. Pronunciation Guides Use Spanish Phonetics
- "es-TAH bee-EN" (not "ɛˈstɑ biˈɛn")
- "YAH-meh" (not IPA symbols)
- "GRAH-see-ahs" (not phonetic alphabet)

**Interpretation:** Spanish speakers learning to pronounce English

### 3. "Context" Fields Explain When to Use English Phrases
- "Always verify name before letting them in"
- "First thing to say when entering restaurant"
- "Shows proactive service attitude"

**Interpretation:** Teaching when/how to use English in work situations

### 4. Target Audience Explicitly Stated
Every file has:
```json
{
  "targetAudience": "gig-workers",
  "culturalContext": "US [work environment]"
}
```

**Interpretation:** Workers IN US system, not teaching Spanish TO US workers

## What Would WRONG Direction Look Like?

### ❌ If teaching Spanish to English speakers:
```json
{
  "spanish": "¿Está bien?",
  "english": "Are you okay?",
  "pronunciation": "es-TAH bee-EN",
  "context": "Check on Spanish-speaking customer"
}
```
This would be teaching English speakers to say Spanish phrases.

### ✅ What we ACTUALLY have:
```json
{
  "english": "Are you okay?",
  "spanish": "¿Está bien?",
  "pronunciation": "ar yoo oh-KAY",
  "context": "Always check passenger after incident"
}
```
This teaches Spanish speakers to say English phrases.

**Our resources use the SECOND (correct) pattern!**

---

## Pronunciation Guide Analysis

### Our Pattern (CORRECT for Spanish→English):
```
"Call 911" → "YAH-meh al nweh-veh-OO-noh OO-noh"
```
This is Spanish phonetic approximation of English sounds.

### If Wrong Direction (English→Spanish):
```
"¿Está bien?" → "es-TAH bee-EN"
```
This would be English phonetic approximation of Spanish sounds.

**Our resources consistently use Spanish phonetics for English words.**
**This proves Spanish speakers are the learners.**

## Colombian Cultural Context Evidence

### Every Resource References Colombian Culture:

1. **accident-procedures.json**
   - "Stricter enforcement than Colombian informal accident resolution"

2. **medical-emergencies.json**
